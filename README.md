# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The system analyzes user preferences and movie features to predict ratings and recommend relevant movies to users.

## Project Goals
- Develop accurate prediction models for user movie preferences
- Compare performance of different recommendation algorithms
- Create a system that can suggest personalized movie recommendations
- Analyze user behavior patterns to improve prediction accuracy

## Dataset
The project uses the MovieLens dataset provided by GroupLens Research. This dataset includes:
- 100,004 ratings on 9,125 movies by 671 users
- Movie metadata including titles, genres, and tags
- User rating history and tagging behavior

## Features
- Collaborative filtering algorithms (user-based and item-based)
- Content-based recommendation using movie features
- Hybrid recommendation approaches
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of recommendation patterns

## Technologies
- Python for data processing and model implementation
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning components
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning models
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Run the preprocessing scripts to prepare the data
4. Train models using the provided notebooks
5. Evaluate model performance with test datasets
6. Generate recommendations using the trained models
